# creative_coding_f25
Repository for my Creative Coding course

The projects were made in three "phases" or "sprints";

In sprint 1 I partially recreated piece 16 of Anton Bruhin's Seest√ºcke series and then played around with the different elements.
In the followin steps I tried implementing different options of interaction.

In sprint 2, I experimented with chrome-browser extensions that play with (the usability of) websites
Move It makes the browser window flee from the user's mouse position.
Tunnelvision hides the whole page behind a dark cover - except the user's mouse, which functions similar to a flashlight to look behind the cover.
MicScrolling disables scrolling with the mouse or buttons. Instead, scrolling is done with noises caught by the microphone. Loud noises scroll down, quieter noises scroll up, silence leaves the page unmoved.
