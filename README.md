# creative_coding_f25
Repository for my Creative Coding course

The projects were made in three "phases" or "sprints";
In sprint 1 I partially recreated piece 16 of Anton Bruhin's Seest√ºcke series and then played around with the different elements.
In the followin steps I tried implementing different options of interaction.

In sprint 2, I experimented with chrome-browser extensions that play with (the usability of) websites.
