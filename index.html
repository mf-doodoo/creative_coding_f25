  <h1>Sprint 1</h1>
  For the first sprint our group chose “Seestück 16” by Anton Bruhin from his “Seestücke” series. 
  The series was made using word processing software to create images, then printing and sometimes reworking them with water colors. 
  The reason we chose this piece is mainly because we thought it was aesthetically pleasing, the mixture between abstract shapes with “realistic” shapes (like the boat or the room) makes for an interesting mix. 
  Additionally, all three of us are not very experienced with javascript and we thought that these pictures would be easier to replicate or code than others.

      <p>
        It's been about a year since the last time I coded in p5.js, so at first, I was cautious about coming up with ideas; 
        however, I knew even before the course started, that I wanted to create something that was, at least to some extent, interactive. 
        Interaction to me is essential to digital art, because it fully implements the unique features of its (digital) medium and includes the audiences themselves; the recipient turns from uninvolved «passerby» to participating collaborator.

      <h2>v2.0</h2>

      <p>
        Writing the code went unexpectedly well; while I do not remember all of what I had learned last year, I was still able to quickly get back into it. 
        My plan was to recreate the most important elements in the picture and then modify them in a way that would implement some form of interaction. 
        I started with the background, which consists of simple lines going across the canvas. Then I tried recreating the ellipse-shaped objects. 
        Our lecturer recommended focusing on the lower objects, as the other ones are very complex to reproduce (I welcome the warning). 
        Lastly, I constructed the «hollow box» by placing 4 separate quads on top of each other, to add the illusion of depth.

      <h2>v3.0</h2>

      <p>
        With these parts, I then started to implement simple interactions: I used the mouse coordinates to change the size and shape of the objects and then added more variables for color. 
        Finally, I added an interaction over the microphone and a «wave» offset, so the incoming sounds are visualised in a visually pleasing way. 
        At this point I decided to focus mainly on the box, as I found the ellipses rather unfitting.

<h1>Sprint 2</h1>
In Sprint 2, we had to deal with the topic of “Take a break”. 
We were shown some examples that had rather disruptive effects on browsing behavior and thus prevented users from using the Internet in its “normal form” and consuming content. 
Our task was to program one or more browser extensions that dealt with breaks - whether this meant pauses or “broken systems” was an open question. 
I was very happy with this topic, as I had already worked on such a browser extension in another module, but unfortunately didn't have the time to finish it.

      <h2>Tunnelvision</h2>
      <img src="images/tunnelvision.gif" alt="">
      <p>
        In unserer Gruppe entschieden wir uns dann, Sehschwächen als Unterthema zu wählen und dieses mit “Take a break” zu verknüpfen. 
        Wir alle arbeiteten fortan an unseren Interpretationen dieser Themen; meine Idee dazu war, einen “Tunnelblick” zu simulieren. 
        Das Internet ist prall gefüllt mit Inhalten, Anzeigen, Animationen und, und, und. Aus diesem Grund fand ich es spannend, unseren Augen eine Pause zu gönnen, indem ich das Sichtbare auf einen kleinen Bereich zu fokussieren und den Rest nicht sichtbar zu machen. 
        Ich brauchte mehrere Anläufe, um das ganze richtig aufzubauen, da ich ein Element über die ganze Webseite spannen wollte und ich immer wieder Probleme mit dem Aktivieren der Extension hatte.

        Nebenbei habe ich an weiteren Extensions gearbeitet, die sich mit anderen disruptiven Aspekten auseinandersetzen; 
        eine davon lässt das Browserfenster vor der Maus fliehen...
